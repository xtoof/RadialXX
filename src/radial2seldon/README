                       Radial to  Seldon
                             R2S
                         version 0.1.2
 
   This file has been written to Radial++ with the spirit to incorporate
   the classical overloaded operators between vectors and matrices
   in the library called Seldon.
  
   The original idea of this functions was taken from Blitz and suggested 
   by Vivien Mallet.
   
   This is a naive implementation, further work to diminish this drawback
   are undertaken by the authors of Seldon and Radial++.
  


The functions provided are:

       Vector <-- function ( Vector ) 
     
       Matrix <-- function ( Matrix ) 

where Vector and Matrix are declared by Vector<T> and 
Matrix<T>, that is, a full-storage, RowMajor.

The provided 'function' are:

   sin  cos  tan  acos  asin  atan
   cosh sinh tanh
   exp  log  log10
   sqrt 
   ceil fabs floor
    
in addition, to perform power function by using and integer
as second argument, we have 

   pow2  pow3  pow4  pow5  pow6  pow7  pow8

The power function (pow(x,y)) applied at each element of the
Vector or Matrix are overloaded by the operator ^


       Vector <-- Vector^T 
     
       Matrix <-- Matrix^T
       
this is similar to use the operator '.^' in Octave or Matlab.        



The overloaded arithmetic operators for Vector and Matrices are:


        Vector <--  Vector op T
        Vector <--    T    op Vector
        Matrix <--  Matrix op T
        Matrix <--    T    op Matrix
   
where op = +, -, *  and  T  = scalar

Also, the classical operators
        Vector <--  Vector +/- Vector
        Matrix <--  Matrix +/- Matrix
         
Finally, three more especific functions

       Vector <-- pdot(Vector,Vector)
                  similar to '.*' in Matlab

       Vector <-- Matrix * Vector 

       Matrix  <--  Matrix * Matrix 
       
       
Note: if is defined the macro

             #define RADIAL_WITH_C_CODE       
      
      the above functions use the hand code C implementation developed 
      by the author of Radial, in otherwise, we call the functions 
      provided by the author of Seldon.
